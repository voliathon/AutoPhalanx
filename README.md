# AutoDefense

**AutoDefense** (v1.0.0) is a consolidated Windower 4 addon for Final Fantasy XI that manages your defensive gear swaps automatically. It currently handles **Phalanx** and **Cursna** by inspecting incoming packets to detect spells cast on you from other party members.

## Features

### 🛡️ Auto Phalanx
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically equips `sets.Phalanx` when **Phalanx** or **Phalanx II** is cast on you.
* **AoE Logic:** Intelligent detection for **Accession + Phalanx**. The addon calculates the distance between you and the spell's target. If you are within range (10 yalms) to receive the buff, it swaps your gear.
* **Packet Precision:** Uses advanced sub-parameter detection to distinguish between Phalanx I and II, ensuring reliable triggers even if the server sends generic animation IDs.

### 💀 Auto Cursna
* **Doom Safety Check:** Swaps to `sets.CursnaReceived` **ONLY** if you are currently **Doomed**.
    * If you are not Doomed, the addon ignores Cursna casts to prevent unnecessary gear swaps.
* **AoE Support:** Just like Phalanx, it detects **Accession + Cursna** and checks if you are in range and Doomed before swapping.
* **Anti-Spam:** Intelligent timer handling prevents your gear from resetting mid-cast if multiple healers are spamming Cursna on you simultaneously.

### ⚡ Shared Features
* **Party Requirement:** To save resources, the logic **only** runs when you are in a party. If you are Solo, the addon stays dormant.
* **Auto-Reset:** Automatically sends a command to your GearSwap to reset your gear 4 seconds after the last spell is detected.
* **Self-Cast Safety:** Ignores your own casting to prevent conflicts with GearSwap's standard midcast logic.

## Installation
1.  Create a folder named `AutoDefense` inside your Windower `addons` directory:
    `.../Windower4/addons/AutoDefense/`
2.  Place `auto_defense.lua` into this folder.

## Configuration (Addon Side)
Open `auto_defense.lua` in a text editor. Look for the configuration section at the top:

```lua
local phalanx_cmd = 'gs equip sets.Phalanx'
local cursna_cmd  = 'gs equip sets.CursnaReceived'
```

* **Note on Case Sensitivity:** Ensure `sets.Phalanx` and `sets.CursnaReceived` match the exact capitalization of the sets in your GearSwap file.

---

## ⚠️ GearSwap Integration (Required) ⚠️

For the **Auto-Reset** feature to work (returning you to your Tank/Idle set after the spell lands), you **MUST** add a specific command handler to your GearSwap file (e.g., `run.lua`).

### 1. Define Your Sets
Ensure these sets exist in your `get_sets()` function:

```lua
sets.Phalanx = {
    -- Your Phalanx received gear (Taeon, Herculean, etc.)
}

sets.CursnaReceived = {
    ring1="Purity Ring",
    waist="Gishdubar Sash",
    legs="Shabti Cuisses +1",
    -- Any other gear that improves Cursna success rate
}
```

### 2. Update `self_command`
Find the function named `self_command(command)` in your job Lua and add the `update` block:

```lua
function self_command(command)
    -- ... your existing commands (C8, C9, etc.) ...

    -- ADD THIS BLOCK:
    elseif command == 'update' then
        equip_current() -- Or whatever function resets your gear
        send_command('@input /echo <----- GearSwap Update Triggered ----->')
    end
end
```

**Why is this needed?**
The addon sends `gs c update` to tell your client "The spell is done, put my normal gear back on." If your `self_command` function does not explicitly listen for `'update'`, your gear will get stuck in the defensive set.

## Usage
Load the addon in-game:
```text
//lua l AutoDefense
```

### Testing
1.  **Join a Party:** The addon will not trigger if you are Solo.
2.  **Phalanx Test:** Have a party member cast Phalanx on you. Your gear should swap to `sets.Phalanx`.
3.  **Cursna Test:**
    * **Normal:** Have someone cast Cursna on you while you are healthy. **Nothing should happen.**
    * **Doomed:** Get Doomed (e.g., from a spell or ability). Have someone cast Cursna. Your gear should swap to `sets.CursnaReceived`.

## Requirements
* Windower 4
* `resources` library (Standard)
